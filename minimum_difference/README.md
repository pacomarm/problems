# Minimum absolute difference of server loads
## Given an array of N integers (ex: [1,2,3,5,13]) distribute the given integers between two groups in the way that, the absolute difference of respective sums is minimized. 
### For this example, the two groups would be G1: [13] and G2: [1,2,3,5] with a minimum difference of 2.
